# AI Security Reporting Summary Mechanism

This is a proof of concept which grabs report data generated by a system,
feeds it through a locally hosted AI model and output it to the screen for 
further usage

# Prerequisites
- Docker Engine
- Python 3.12 (What I use)
- Make
- Relatively beefy machine

# Setup
Run the following commands to set up the Model (You can press CTRL-d to quit the prompt window which pops up)
```
make lama-start run-lama32
```

Once the model is setup and running run the following command to install the necessary packages
```
make install
```

Once everything is installed run the following commands to test!
```
make run
```

As this is a proof of concept, the data it embeds is hard coded but it's
pretty trivial to implement a way to fetch the necessary data and convert it
into a string which can then be used to prompt through
